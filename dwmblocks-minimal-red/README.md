# dwmblocks-minmal

Modular status bar for dwm written in c.

This config is to be just that little bit less cluttered, and a just that little bit more efficient.

## Scripts

The scripts needed for my build are in the scripts directory of this repo, but they should be put in the `~/.dwm/scripts/` directory on your computer.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Zaedus/dwmblocks-minmal
cd dwmblocks-minmal
sudo make clean install
```

It should be that simple!
